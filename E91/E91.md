Author: ChinTe LIAO (liao.chinte@veriqloud.fr)

## Function

E91 protocol is one of Quantum Key Distribution that generate a key pair within two parties.


## To Do

- Add quantum processor interface when Alice measure qubits.

## Status

Now The protocol is able to run with noises applied on operations/measurements when:

- Alice prepare qubits.
- Bob measure qubits.

17/02/2020
- Bug fixed and be able to handle various qubit losses.

14/02/2020

- Quantum Processor interface applied when Bob measure.


7/02/2020

- Quantum Processor interface applied when Alice prepares qubits.
- Alice and Bob measure in normal interface.
