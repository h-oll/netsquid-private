# How to run simulation
1. Update BB84 file to **../BB84/BB84.py** into current directory if not done already.
2. Configure your simulation only in function **QC_plot**.
3. Run the python script in terminal:
```
python QuantumCheque.py
```
An index graph will show and indicate how the cheque is available to bank according to time
with different configurations(depolar rate).
